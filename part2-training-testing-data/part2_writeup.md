# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
Answer: The model has some level of independence since the model trains itself, while the previous lesson model just makes assumptions regarding the data.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
Answer: 0.5377498053683916, this value shows the model is not that correlated.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.

Answer: The model is partially accurate and there is relative correlation with age and blood pressure in real life, and the R^2 value of 0.5 is relatively bad but not horrendous. The meaning is that the arteries and blood pressure will change with age.
