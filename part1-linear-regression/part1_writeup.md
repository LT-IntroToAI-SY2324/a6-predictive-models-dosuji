# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model?
Answer: The r squared value is the average distance between the data points from the predicted value and the best fit line. This says that the linear regression model fits the data since it is 0.6 and a value of less than 0.5 means it does not fit well.
2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?
Answer: 137.46185286
3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?

Answer: The model's prediction is relatively accurate but not relatively consistent or reliable to predict someone's blood pressure based on their age. The model is reliant on the database which is a relatively small data sample in retrospect and since other tests were not conducted, it can not be said that the model is 100% accurate.
